# ProteinCoiledCoilOptimizer

Monte-carlo search employed to interface with Rosetta and APBS-PDB2PQR to design coiled-coil hydrogels with targeted Rosetta Scores and Electrostatic Potential Energies

To use please change your path for rosetta, pdb2pqr, and apbs software respectively
The code is currently setup for 54 residue coiled-coils respectively possessing a 16 residue histag. While we believe dEEbcf is a modular metric, its use in longer or shorter coiled-coils has not been verified and its functionality is not included here. Please email: drb450@nyu.edu if there is any interest in adapting this code for other protein lengths, or other proteins.
